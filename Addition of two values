#Addition of two values.

value1=int(input("Please enter the first value:"))
value2=int(input("Please enter the second value:"))
sum=value1+value2
print("Addition:",sum)



'''1.value1=int(input("Please enter the first value:")):

This line prompts the user to input a value.
The input() function takes input from the user as a string.
The int() function then converts the string input into an integer.
The result is stored in the variable value1.
2.value2=int(input("Please enter the second value:")):

Similar to the first line, this prompts the user to enter another value, which is converted into an integer and stored in the variable value2.
3.sum=value1+value2:

This line adds the two integer values (value1 and value2) together and stores the result in the variable sum.
4.print("Addition:", sum):

This line prints the result of the addition.
The print() function displays the message "Addition:" followed by the value of the sum variable (which is the result of adding value1 and value2).
Example
If the user enters:

value1 = 5
value2 = 7
The output would be:
Addition: 12'''
